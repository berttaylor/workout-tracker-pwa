# Workout Tracker PWA

A Progressive Web App for tracking gym workouts with intelligent progression algorithms and offline functionality.

## üèãÔ∏è Features

### **Three Progression Types**
- **Rep+**: Increases reps first (5‚Üí6), then weight with reset to baseline reps
- **Basic**: Direct weight increases on successful completion
- **Static**: No progression (for cardio exercises)

### **Smart Failure Handling**
- **Buffer System**: At increased reps, failure drops to baseline without weight penalty
- **2-Strike Rule**: Two consecutive failures trigger weight reduction
- **Minimum Weight Protection**: Prevents weight going below safe minimums

### **Workout Management**
- **Push + Calfs**: Shoulder press, Pectoral machine, Chest incline, Tricep pulldowns, Calf raises, Cross trainer
- **Pull + Glutes**: Vertical traction, Seated row, Upper back, Biceps cable, Hip abduction, Cross trainer
- **Cardio Day**: Run or swim sessions

### **Progress Tracking**
- **Detailed Progress Log**: Shows weight increases, rep progressions, and failures with clear reasoning
- **Session History**: Track every workout with date stamps and progression changes
- **Incomplete Exercise Handling**: Warns when ending workouts early

### **Mobile Optimized**
- **PWA Installation**: Add to iPhone home screen for offline use
- **Touch-Friendly**: Optimized for iPhone 13 mini and similar devices
- **No Zoom Issues**: Prevents accidental zoom on rapid button taps

## üì± Installation

### **iPhone Setup**
1. Open Safari and go to: `https://berttaylor.github.io/workout-tracker-pwa`
2. Tap the Share button (box with arrow)
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. Name it "Workout" and tap "Add"

## üéØ How to Use

### **Starting a Workout**
1. Select your workout type (Push + Calfs, Pull + Glutes, or Cardio Day)
2. Each exercise shows current weight, target reps, and progression type
3. Complete sets by tapping "Add Set" or "Complete"
4. Mark failures with "Fail (X/2)" button

### **Understanding Progression Types**
- **Rep+**: Green badge - alternates between rep increases and weight increases
- **Basic**: Blue badge - increases weight directly on success
- **Static**: Gray badge - no automatic progression

### **Set Tracking**
- Progress counter shows completed sets (e.g., "3/5 Sets")
- Exercises turn green when all sets completed
- Failed exercises turn gray and are blocked from further attempts

### **Ending Workouts**
- Tap "End Workout" at bottom of exercise list
- App warns if exercises are incomplete
- All progression changes apply only when ending workout

## üìä Progress Log

The Progress Log shows detailed workout history:

**Example Entry:**
```
Thu, 27 Jun                    Push + Calfs
Shoulder press: 30kg ‚Üí 32.5kg (5 reps)
Pectoral machine: 5 ‚Üí 6 reps
Tricep pulldowns: Failed (2/2) - 22.5kg ‚Üí 20kg
Calf raises: Incomplete
```

### **Log Entry Types**
- **Weight increases**: `30kg ‚Üí 32.5kg (5 reps)`
- **Rep increases**: `5 ‚Üí 6 reps`
- **Failures with penalties**: `Failed (2/2) - 22.5kg ‚Üí 20kg`
- **Buffer protection**: `Failed (2/2) - 6 ‚Üí 5 reps`
- **Incomplete exercises**: `Incomplete`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **Exercise Configuration**
Each exercise includes:
- `startWeight`: Initial weight/duration
- `minimumWeight`: Safety floor (can go below start weight)
- `repRange`: [min, max] rep targets
- `increment`: Amount to increase weight
- `sets`: Number of sets required
- `progressionType`: "rep", "simple", or "none"

### **Customization**
- Edit `getDefaultConfig()` in `app.js` to modify exercises
- All data stored locally in browser localStorage
- Export function provides JSON backup of all data

## üîß Technical Details

## üéØ Workout Philosophy

This app implements a **double progression** system inspired by proven strength training methodologies:

1. **Progressive Overload**: Gradual increases in weight or reps
2. **Autoregulation**: Progression based on performance, not calendar
3. **Deload Protection**: Buffer system prevents excessive weight reduction
4. **Minimum Effective Dose**: Only progress when warranted

### **Progression Examples**

**Rep+ Exercise (Shoulder Press):**
- Week 1: 30kg √ó 5 reps ‚úì ‚Üí 30kg √ó 6 reps
- Week 2: 30kg √ó 6 reps ‚úì ‚Üí 32.5kg √ó 5 reps
- Week 3: 32.5kg √ó 5 reps ‚úì ‚Üí 32.5kg √ó 6 reps

**Basic Exercise (Calf Raises):**
- Week 1: 7.5kg √ó 8 reps ‚úì ‚Üí 10kg √ó 8 reps
- Week 2: 10kg √ó 8 reps ‚úì ‚Üí 12.5kg √ó 8 reps
